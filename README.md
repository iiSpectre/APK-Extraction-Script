# APK-Extraction-Script
Recursively scans for APK files, extracts their contents, and collects embedded image assets (PNG, JPG, JPEG). Images are labeled as Bugdroid-related or general based on path and filename keywords, then copied to separate output directories with collision-safe, resolution-prefixed filenames.
